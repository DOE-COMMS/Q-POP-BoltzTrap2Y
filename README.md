# BoltzTraP2Y

BoltzTraP2Y is a high-throughput first-principles calculation software we developed based on BoltzTraP2 to provide thermodynamic and kinetic input data for phase-field simulations.

Please check the [BoltzTrap2 repository](https://gitlab.com/sousaw/BoltzTraP2) for installation of the BoltzTrap2 software.
